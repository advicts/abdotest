# Hoin-POS-58-80
Drivers for the Hoin HOP-E801 point of sale thermal receipt printer with variable paper width 58 or 80 millimeters.

I bought the HOP-E801 thermal receipt printer from http://hoinprinter.com/ but the compiled linux drivers were built on a 32-bit system so the filter would fail to print with CUPS on my Raspberry Pi 3. The source was available on the little CD they sent with it and seems to be a fork of the [ZJ-58 thermal printer drivers](https://github.com/klirichek/zj-58) (that's probably fine because many thermal reciept printers share the same printing commands). The PPD seems to work well, it's just the rastertopos filter that stalls/fails the print queue if you're using the wrong one. You can fork this repo to make your own paper sizes or whatnot, or maybe you came here just to download the [64-bit version of the filter I re-compiled](/filter). So if you're having problems with the factory-supplied rastertopos filter and don't know where to start troubleshooting, it might be just that you have to take the file `rastertopos` (for 80mm paper) or `rastertopos58` (if you're using 58mm mode) and copy it into `/usr/lib/cups/filter/` on your host printing computer.

For those who came here for the factoy--supplied `rastertopos` and `rastertopos58` (built for 32-bit hosts) you can grab that from [the filter folder](/filter) too, or again you can build it yourself.

For whatever reason, the 58mm ppd and rastertopos58 filter did not have the cutter function, so I added that from the 80mm version (but only 64-bit so you'll have to recompile that for 32-bit if you need the cutter).
